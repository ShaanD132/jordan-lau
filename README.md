# Jordan Lau's Portfolio Website
This was a fun project to do and was made for a friend. I learnt a lot about ReactJS, ChakraUI which makes it easy to make responsive elements and designs. 

## Project Reflection
This was my first proper project using ReactJS and learning how to use animations in a web app. It did take longer than I anticipated to design everything properly and I learned more about the design process. Using an application like Figma to design the UI beforehand saves a lot of time. I focused purely on Front-End Development in this project.
